## Objective: 
The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI-based solution that can effectively represent 
knowledge and generate insights from any structured dataset. The solution should be capable of 
processing and analyzing structured data, identifying patterns, and generating meaningful insights that 
can aid in decision-making processes.

## Problem Description: 
In the era of big data, organizations across various sectors are generating massive amounts of data 
every day. This data, if processed and analyzed correctly, can provide valuable insights that can 
significantly improve the decision-making process. However, the challenge lies in effectively 
representing this knowledge and extracting useful insights from it.

Your task is to develop an AI-based solution that can handle this challenge. You will be provided with a 
structured dataset. Your solution should be able to process this dataset, represent the knowledge 
contained within it effectively, and generate meaningful insights.

The solution should include the following features:

1. **Data Pre-processing**: The solution should be able to clean and pre-process the dataset to make it 
suitable for further analysis.
2. **Knowledge Representation**: The solution should effectively represent the knowledge contained 
within the dataset. This could be in the form of graphs, charts, or any other visual representation 
that makes the data easy to understand.
3. **Pattern Identification**: The solution should be able to identify patterns within the dataset. This 
could include identifying trends, anomalies, or any other patterns that could provide valuable 
insights.
4. **Insight Generation**: Based on the identified patterns, the solution should generate meaningful 
insights. These insights should be presented in a clear and understandable manner.
5. **Scalability**: The solution should be scalable. It should be able to handle datasets of varying sizes 
and complexities.
6. **User-friendly Interface**: The solution should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to 
easily interact with it and understand the generated insights

## About the Project

Knowledge Representation is an advanced AI solution that transforms raw data into actionable knowledge. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, our tool provides a user-friendly interface for data analysis, visualization, and insight generation. It addresses the critical need for efficient data processing and insight extraction in the age of information overload.

## How It Works

### Process Flow

![Process Flow](<reports/img/Knowrep Process diagram - Bit Bandits.png>)

1. **Upload**: Users upload their CSV files through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Process**: The application pre-processes the data, handling encoding detection and basic cleaning.
3. **Analyze**: Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the tool identifies patterns and generates insights.
4. **Visualize**: Results are presented through clear, interactive visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
5. **Interact**: Users can ask questions about their data using natural language, which are answered by our AI agent.
6. **Predict**: For applicable datasets, users can run machine learning predictions using various algorithms.
